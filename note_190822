- JVM: Java Virtual Machine
=> ensures the same Java code can be run on different operating systems and platforms. 

- Each file has one primary class named after the file. 

-Java is a compiled programming language, 
meaning the code we write in a .java file is transformed into byte code by a compiler before it is executed by the Java Virtual Machine on your computer.

public class ClassName {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    
  }
}

To compile: javac FileName.java => generate a FileName.class file
To execute: java FileName
