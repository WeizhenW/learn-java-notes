FROM CODECADEMY - LEARN JAVA COURSE

- JVM: Java Virtual Machine
=> ensures the same Java code can be run on different operating systems and platforms. 

- Each file has one primary class named after the file. 
- Java programs have at least one class and one main() method.
Each class represents one real-world idea.
The main() method runs the tasks of the program.

-Java is a compiled programming language, 
meaning the code we write in a .java file is transformed into byte code by a compiler before it is executed by the Java Virtual Machine on your computer.

public class ClassName {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    
  }
}

To compile: javac FileName.java => generate a FileName.class file
To execute: java FileName
-----------------------------------
VARIABLES!
- declare a VARIABLE
  int sizeOfClass = 12;
  boolean isCompleted = false;
  double priceOfBook = 21.21;
  String nameOfStudent = "James Bond";

- Primitive data types - no built in behavior:
  int: hold positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. They do not store fractions or numbers with decimals in them.
  double: double can hold decimals as well as very large and very small numbers.
  boolean
  char: The char data type can hold any character, like a letter, space, or punctuation mark. It must be surrounded by single quotes

- String - objects with built in behavior - not primitive data type:
- Static typing
  Static typing helps because bugs are caught during programming rather than during execution of the code.
  Javaâ€™s static typing helps programmers avoid runtime errors, and thus have much safer code that is free from bugs.
